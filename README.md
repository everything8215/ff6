# Final Fantasy VI Disassembly

This is a disassembly of Final Fantasy VI for the Super Famicom (i.e. Final
Fantasy III for the SNES). It is a work in progress which builds the
following ROMs:

- Final Fantasy III 1.0 (U), CRC32: `0xA27F1C7A`
- Final Fantasy III 1.1 (U), CRC32: `0xC0FA0464`

The Japanese version is not currently supported.

## Build Instructions

You will need a Unix-like shell to build the ROM. If you are on a Mac or
Linux, simply open a terminal. If you are using Windows, you will need to
use a Unix-like runtime environment such as Cygwin: <https://www.cygwin.com>.

### Install Dependencies

First, install the following dependencies if you don't have them already.

- GNU Make: <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
- cc65: <https://cc65.github.io>
- Python 3: <https://www.python.org/>

Here is a very nice tutorial explaining how to set up Cygwin and cc65 on
a Windows machine: <https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-hello-cc65>

### Clone the Repo

If you have git installed, run `git clone
https://github.com/everything8215/ff6.git`. Otherwise, click on "Code" in
GitHub and select "Download ZIP" to copy the repo to your computer.

### Rip ROM Data

Copy an unmodified FF6 ROM file into the "vanilla" directory. If you want to
build both the Japanese version and the English version, you will need to copy
both ROMs. If your ROMs have a 512-byte copier header, you will need to remove
it first. There are many tools available on romhacking.net that can detect and
remove a copier header from a ROM file.

All of the data can be extracted from either a v1.0 ROM or a v1.1 ROM. For
this step there is no difference between the two versions.

Next, run `make rip` in the root directory to extract all of the required data
from your ROMs. You should only need to do this once. The extracted data will
be saved in the module directories. If you later wish to revert any of these
files to their original state, simply delete those files and run `make rip`
again, as it will only create files that do not exist and will not affect
existing files.

### Assemble and Link ROM File

Run `make <version>` to make the version of the ROM that you want, where
`<version>` is one of the following values:

- `ff6-en`: Final Fantasy III 1.0 (U)
- `ff6-en1`: Final Fantasy III 1.1 (U)

The ROM will be created in the `rom` directory.

After building the vanilla ROMs, you are free to modify the code and data as
you like, then run `make` again to rebuild the ROM. Some switchable config
options can be found in the file `include/const.inc`. This includes a "debug"
mode that allows you to skip the intro.

## Distributing ROM Hacks

To avoid legal troubles, I believe that it's important to avoid distributing
copyrighted intellectual property. This repository does not contain any such
material, and instead allows you to extract all necessary data from your ROM
files.

ROM hacks are typically distributed by generating a patch file which
modifies a few bytes when applied to a ROM file. However, reassembling an
entire ROM from scratch can cause large blocks of data to be shuffled around,
resulting in patch files which contain copyrighted data when using the IPS
patch format. To avoid this, ROM hacks made from this code should be
distributed by creating forks of this repository or by using more sophisticated
patch formats which are able to differentiate data that has been modified from
data that has simply been relocated (i.e. XDelta or Delta BPS). When creating
a fork, make sure to run `make distclean` prior to each commit to delete all
copyrighted assets from your repo. Be aware that this will delete all text
and files which were extracted via `make rip`, including files that you have
modified. If in doubt, make a backup copy of the repo prior to cleaning
the repo directory.

## Format and Organization

In order to create a somewhat cohesive and standardized disassembly, I try to
follow a set of rules for how files in the repo are formatted and organized.

### Assembler and Linker

The code for Final Fantasy games is typically split into several distinct
modules. The field or map module and the battle module are always present.
The battle code is often split into two parts, one for battle mechanics and
the other for battle graphics. There is also a menu module, though in some of
the early games the menu code was mixed in with the field code. The music and
sound code is also always in a separate module. Other modules can include
cutscenes, intro/ending credits, special effects, and the 3D world map for
FF6.

Because of this modular structure, I find it convenient to assemble each
module as a single object file and then link the modules together to create
the ROM file. These two steps are done using ca65 and ld65, respectively.
This strategy leads to a reasonable number of import/export commands, as the
separate modules only interact with one another via a small number of external
subroutines and data locations.

### File Formats, Names, and Extensions

Assembly files have the extension `.asm`. In addition to assembly code this
includes files which contain scripts, and memory labels but contain no actual
code. In most cases, assembly files should only be assembled once. The only
exception is when the ROM contains multiple identical copies of the same
subroutine or data.

Include files have the extension `.inc`. These files can be
included multiple times and should not output any bytes to the assembler or
reserve any memory addresses. Examples include macro definitions, hardware
address definitions, and definitions of constant expressions. Include files
should begin with an include guard to ensure that they are not included more
than once.

Native graphics files should have an extension which describes the graphics
format such as `.4bpp` for 4 bits per pixel SNES graphics. SNES Palette files
(BGR555 format) should have the extension `.pal`. Screen tilemap files should
have the extension `.scr`.

Other binary data files can have any reasonable extension. I usually use `.dat`
if I can't think of anything better.

Compressed data files should have the same filename and extension as their
uncompressed counterpart with an appropriate extension added at the end, e.g.
`image.cgx.lz` is the compressed version of `image.cgx` in the same directory.

### File Organization

Tge `src` directory contains all of the assembly code and game data. The
`include` directory contains all of the include files.

Each of the modules described above is in a separate subdirectory within the
`src` directory. This mimics my best guess as to how the original source code
was organized based on e.g. the Playstation releases where each module has a
directory named after the main programmer for that module ('NARITA', 'YOSHII',
etc.). Each module directory contains all of the source code and data for that
module. The root directory of the repo contains a Makefile to assemble each
module and link all of the object files together to create the ROM.

Each module also has a subdirectory in the `include` directory which can
contain include files related to that module.

The `tools` directory contains a set of python scripts which are used to
extract and modify game data.

The `notes` directory contains my notes from reverse engineering the
assembly code.

The `cfg` directory contains linker configuration files which ensure that the
assembled game data is placed in the ROM to match the original versions. I
don't know what assembler and linker were used to build the game by the
original development team, but it worked somewhat differently than ca65 and
ld65. Because of this, I have to use a lot more modules than would typically
be used in order to build a program of this size and complexity.

### Naming Conventions

As a naming convention for symbols, I've chosen to follow the example of the
Pok√©mon reverse engineering team (<https://github.com/pret>). Subroutine names
and labels for data in the ROM use PascalCase. Acronyms like RAM appear in all
capitals (i.e. InitRAM). This differs from conventional camel-case
capitalization rules. The Apple II DeskTop project has some nice ca65
coding style conventions here (<https://github.com/a2stuff/a2d/blob/main/docs/Coding_Style.md>)
although I'm not sure how strictly I would want to follow them.

External subroutines (which can be called by other modules) get the special
suffix `_ext`. Also, dummy subroutines called by another bank (typically a
`jsr` followed by `rtl` or `jsl` followed by `rts` on the 65c816) get the
special suffix `_far` or `_near`, respectively.

I've added descriptive labels for many the subroutines in the code. Labels
for unknown or unlabeled subroutines are the 6-digit ROM address of the
subroutine (including the bank) preceded by an underscore, e.g. `_c28566`.

Local labels inside subroutines use mixed case with a prepended `@` symbol,
which is ca65's default symbol to identify a local label. Most local labels
are unnamed, and instead use the 4-digit ROM address (excluding the bank). I
also typically include a local label at the start of each subroutine so that
it can be compared to the original ROM file, but these are just for convenience
and can be removed eventually.

WRAM and SRAM labels begin with a lowercase `w` or `s` followed by a
descriptive name in PascalCase case, e.g. `wSpriteData`.

Hardware registers are a slight exception to the rule. I chose to use the
official register names from the SNES development manual in all caps,
prepended with a lowercase 'h' (i.e. `$2100` is `hINIDISP`).

Instruction mnemonics and macro names are in all lowercase. Macro names can
include underscores to improve readability. Constant expressions are in all
uppercase with underscores between words.

To shorten subroutine and label names, the following shortened words are
used:

- anim: animation
- btm: bottom
- char: character
- cmd: command
- ctrl: control or controller
- dec: decrement
- div: divide
- dlg: dialogue
- dur: duration
- elem: element
- exec: execute
- gfx: graphics
- grp: group
- inc: increment
- init: initialize
- mod: modify or modifier
- msg: message
- mult: multiply or multiplier
- obj: object
- qty: quantity
- pal: palette
- prop: properties
- ptr: pointer
- rand: random
- reg: register
- sfx: sound effect
- tbl: table

### Tabs, Spaces, and Comments

Assembly and include files should not have lines longer than 80 characters.
Never use tabs. Always use spaces. In assembly files, labels begin in column 1,
instructions and macros begin in column 9, operands begin in column 17, and
comments can begin in column 41. Long comments that would extend beyond the
80-character limit should be placed on their own line before the assembly
code that they describe.

An exception to these rules is for scripts made with macros instead of
instruction mnemonics because the macros names are often longer than 7
characters. In this case, operands begin in column 25.
